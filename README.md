# Streamlit Spam Detection App

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project implements a simple web-based Spam Detection System using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It allows users to input a message or email and predicts whether it is "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

## ðŸš€ Features
- Loads a dataset of SMS messages and their labels (spam/ham)
- Uses `CountVectorizer` to convert text data into numerical features
- Trains a `Multinomial Naive Bayes` classifier
- Provides a simple and interactive `Streamlit` interface for real-time message classification
